# tf-model
How the ML model was created.

This repo contains two notebooks. They are as follows:

1. [Megha.ipynb](https://github.com/MeghaApps/tf-model/blob/main/Megha.ipynb)
2. [Megha_MobileNetV2](https://github.com/MeghaApps/tf-model/blob/main/Megha_MobileNetV2.ipynb)

The first notebook contains a custom made CNN implementation for the task of ground-based cloud classification, and the second notebook uses MobileNetV2 to train a model for the same task.
